Try to find a i on array A and corespoding j on array B.

Aleft = A[i]
Aright = A[i+1]

Bright = B[j+1]

Such that Aleft<=Bright and Bleft<=Aright

This means that A[:i+1] and B[:j+1] holds all the elements that is less than the median.
Aright A[i+1:] and B[j+1:] holds all the elements that is larger or equal to the median.
