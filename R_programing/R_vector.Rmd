This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. VECTOR

```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange")
fruits 
```

```{r}
numbers <- c(1,2,3) 
numbers 
```

To create a vector with numerical values in a sequence, use the : operator:

```{r}
# Vector with numerical values in a sequence
numbers <- 1:10

numbers
```

You can also create numerical values with decimals in a sequence, but note that if the last element does not belong to the sequence, it is not used:

```{r}
# Vector with numerical decimals in a sequence
numbers1 <- 1.5:6.5
numbers1

# Vector with numerical decimals in a sequence where the last element is not used
numbers2 <- 1.5:6.3
numbers2
```

In the example below, we create a vector of logical values:

```{r}
# Vector of logical values
log_values <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

log_values
```

Vector Length

To find out how many items a vector has, use the length() function:

```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange")

length(fruits)

```

Sort a Vector

To sort items in a vector alphabetically or numerically, use the sort() function:

```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange","mango", "lemon")
numbers <- c(13,3,5,7,20,2)

sort(fruits) # Sort a string 
sort(numbers) # Sort numbers 

fruits 
numbers
```

Access Vectors

You can access the vector items by referring to its index number inside brackets []. The first item has index 1, the second item has index 2, and so on:

```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange")

# Access the first item (banana)
fruits[1]

fruits[3]
```

You can also access multiple elements by referring to different index positions with the c() function:

```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange", "mango", "lemon")

fruits[c(1,3)]
```

You can also use negative index numbers to access all items except the ones specified:

```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange", "mango", "lemon")

# Access all items except for the first item
fruits[c(-1)]
```

Change an item

To change the value of a specific item, refer to the index number:

```{r}
fruits <- c("banana", "apple", "orange", "mango", "lemon")

# Change "banana" to "pear" 
fruits[1] <- "pear" 

fruits
```

Repeat Vectors

To repeat vectors, use the rep() function:

```{r}
repeat_each <- rep(c(1,2,3), each = 3)
repeat_each
```

Repeat the sequence of the vector:

```{r}
repeat_times <- rep(c(1,2,3), tÃ­mes = 3)
repeat_times 
```

Repeat each value independdently:

```{r}
repeat_indepent <- rep(c(1,2,3), times = c(5,2,1))

repeat_indepent
```

Generating Sequenced Vectors

One of the examples on top, showed you how to create a vector with numerical values in a sequence with the : operator:

```{r}
numbers <- 1:10
numbers 
```

To make bigger or smaller steps in a sequence, use the seq() function:

```{r}
numbers <- seq(from = 0, to = 100, by = 20)

numbers

```

Note: The seq() function has three parameters: from is where the sequence starts, to is where the sequence stops, and by is the interval of the sequence.
