This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r}
Operator <- c("==", "!=", ">", "<", ">=", "<=")

Name <- c("Equal", "Not Equal", "Greater than","Less than", "Greate than or equal to", "Less than or equal to")

Example <- c(" x==y ", "x != y", "x > y", "x <y", "x>=y", "x <= y")

table <- data.frame(Operator, Name, Example)
table
```
R logical Operators 
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements: 

```{r}
Operator <- c("&", "&&", "|","||","!")

Description <- c(
  "Element-wise Logical AND operator. It returns TRUE if both elements are TRUE.",
  "Logical AND operator - Returns TRUE if both statements are TRUE", 
  
  "Elementwise - Logical OR operator. It returns TRUE if one of the statement is TRUE", 
  "Logical OR operator. It returns TRUE if one of the statement is TRUE", 
  "Logical NOT - returns FALSE if statement is TRUE"
)

table <- data.frame(Operator, Description)
table
```
