This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed. Global Variables

Variables that are created outside of a function are known as global variables.

Create a variable outside of a function and use it inside the function:

```{r}
txt <- "awesome"
my_function <- function() {
  print(paste("R is ", txt))
}

my_function() 
```

If you create a variable with the same name inside a function, this variable will be local, and can only be used inside the function. The global variable with the same name will remain as it was, global and with the original value.

```{r}
txt <- "global variable"
my_function <- function() {
  txt = "fantastic"
  print(paste("R is", txt))
}

my_function()

```

The Global Assignment Operator

Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.

To create a global variable inside a function, you can use the global assignment operator \<\<-.

If you use the assignment operator, the variable belongs to the global scope:

```{r}
my_function <- function() {
txt <<- "fantastic"
  paste("R is", txt)
}

my_function()

print(txt)
```

Also, use the global assignment operator if you want to change a global variable inside a function:

```{r}
txt <- "awesome"
my_function <- function() {
  txt <<- "fantastic"
  paste("R is", txt)
}

my_function()

paste("R is", txt)
```
