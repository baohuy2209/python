This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
BOOLEAN (Logical Values)
In programming, you often need to know if an expression is true or false. 
You can evaluate any expression in R, and get one of two answers, `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 
When you compare to values, the expression is evaluates and R returns the logical answer: 
```{r}
10 > 9 # TRUE because 10 is greater than 9 
10 == 9 # FALSE because 10 is not equal to 9 
10 < 9 # FALSE becasue 10 is greater than 9 
```
You can also compare two variables: 
```{r}
a <- 10 
b <- 9 

a>b
```
You can also run a condition in an if statement, which you will learn much more about in the if ... else chapter. 
```{r}
a <- 200 
b <- 33 

if (b > a){
  print("b is greater than a ")
}else{
  print("b is not greater than a")
}
```
