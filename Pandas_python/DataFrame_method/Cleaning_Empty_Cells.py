# Notice in the result that same rows have been removed (row 18, 22 and 28)
# These rows had cells will empty values. 

#One way to deal with empty cells is to remove rows that contain empty cells. 
#This Ã­s usually OK, since data sets can be very big, and removing a few rows will not have a big impact on the result.
