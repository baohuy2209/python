This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
R Functions 

A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. 
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function. 
A function can return data as a result: 
1) Creating a Function: 
To create a function, use the function() keyword:

```{r}
my_function <- function(){
  print("Hello World")
}
my_function() 

```
Arguments: 

```{r}
my_function <- function(name){
  
  print(paste(name, "Griffin")) 
}

my_function("Peter")
my_function("Lois")
my_function("Stewie")
```
Number of Arguments 
By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less:

```{r}
my_function <- function(fname, lname) {
  print(paste(fname, lname))
}

my_function("Peter", "Griffin")
```
Đefault Parameter Value 
The following example shows how to use a dèault parameter value. 
If we call the function without an argument, it uses the default value: 

```{r}
my_function <- function(country = "Norway") {
 print(paste("I am from", country))
}

my_function("Sweden")
my_function("India")
my_function() # will get the default value, which is Norway
my_function("USA")
```
Return values 
To let a function return a result, use the return() value: 

```{r}
my_function <- function(x) {
  return (5 * x)
}

print(my_function(3))
print(my_function(5))
print(my_function(9))
```
NESTED FUNCTIONS 
There are two ways to create a nested function: 
- Call a function within another function. 
- Write a function within a function. 

Call a function within another function: 
```{r}
Nested_function <- function(x,y) {
  a <- x+y 
  return(a) 
}

print(Nested_function(5,6))

```
The function tells x to add y. 
The first input Nested_function(2,2) is "x" of the main function. 
The second input Nested_function(3,3) is "Y" of the main function. 
The output is therefore(2+2) + (3+3) 

Write a function within a function: 
```{r}
Outer_func <- function(x){
  Inner_func <- function(y) {
    a <- x+y 
    return (a) 
  }
  
  return(Inner_func)
}

output <- Outer_func(3) 
print(output(5))  
```
R Function Recursion 

R also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.

Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.

The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly, recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.

In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).

To a new developer it can take some time to work out how exactly this works, best way to find out is by testing and modifying it.

```{r}
tri_recursion <- function(k) {
  if (k > 0) {
    result <- k + tri_recursion(k - 1)
    print(result)
  } else {
    result = 0
    return(result)
  }
}
tri_recursion(6)
```
