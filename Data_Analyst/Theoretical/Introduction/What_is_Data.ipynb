    "Data is measured, collected and reported, and analyzed, whereupon it is often visualized using graphs, images or other analysis tools. Raw data (“unprocessed data”) may be a collection of numbers or characters before it’s been “cleaned” and corrected by researchers. It must be corrected so that we can remove outliers, instrument or data entry errors. Data processing commonly occurs by stages, and therefore the “processed data” from one stage could also be considered the “raw data” of subsequent stage. Field data is data that’s collected in an uncontrolled “in situ” environment. Experimental data is the data that is generated within the observation of scientific investigations."
