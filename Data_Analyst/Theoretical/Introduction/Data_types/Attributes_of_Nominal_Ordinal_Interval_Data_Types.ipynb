Example – Given the attribute drinker narrate a patient item, 1 specify that the drinker drinks, while 0 specify that the patient does not. Similarly, suppose the patient undergoes a medical test that has two practicable outcomes."

Thus, in addition to providing a ranking of values, such attributes allow us to compare and quantify the difference between values. Example – A temperature attribute is an interval – scaled. We have different temperature values for every new day, where each day is an entity. By sequencing the values, we obtain an arrangement of entities with reference to temperature. In addition, we can quantify the difference in the value between values, for example, a temperature of 20 degrees C is five degrees higher than a temperature of 15 degrees C."
