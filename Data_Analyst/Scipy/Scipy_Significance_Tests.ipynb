    "# Scipy Statistical Significance Tests \n",
    "## 1) What is Statistical Significance Test? \n",
    "In statistics, statistical significance means that the result that was produced has a reason behind it, it was not produced randomly, or by chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "SciPy provides us with a module called scipy.stats, which has functions for performing statistical significance tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some techniques and keywords that are important when performing such tests:\n",
    "## 2) Hypothesis in Statistics \n",
    "Hypothesis is an assumption about a parameter in population.\n",
    "## 3) Null Hypothesis \n",
    "It assumes that the observation is not statistically significant.\n",
    "## 4) Alternate Hypothesis \n",
    "It assumes that the observations are due to some reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's alternate to Null Hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For an assessment of a student we would take:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"student is worse than average\" - as a null hypothesis, and:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"student is better than average\" - as an alternate hypothesis.\n",
    "## 5) One tailed test \n",
    "When our hypothesis is testing for one side of the value only, it is called \"one tailed test\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the null hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"the mean is equal to k\", we can have alternate hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"the mean is less than k\", or:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"the mean is greater than k\"\n",
    "## 6) Two tailed test \n",
    "When our hypothesis is testing for both side of the values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For the null hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"the mean is equal to k\", we can have alternate hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"the mean is not equal to k\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case the mean is less than, or greater than k, and both sides are to be checked.\n",
    "## 7) Alpha value \n",
    "Alpha value is the level of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "How close to extremes the data must be for null hypothesis to be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is usually taken as 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1.\n",
    "## 8) P value: \n",
    "P value tells how close to extreme the data actually is.\n",
    "\n",
    "P value and alpha values are compared to establish the statistical significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If p value <= alpha we reject the null hypothesis and say that the data is statistically significant. otherwise we accept the null hypothesis.\n",
    "## 9) T-Test \n",
    "T-tests are used to determine if there is significant deference between means of two variables and lets us know if they belong to the same distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a two tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function ttest_ind() takes two samples of same size and produces a tuple of t-statistic and p-value.\n",
    "Find if the given values v1 and v2 are from same distribution:"
